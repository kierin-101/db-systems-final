# Database Systems Final Project
## Group: Super Epic DB Group

This will use the MLPQ system to act as a play diagrammer for 3v3 basketball.

## Running the Program
1. Open MLPQ
2. Open `basketball.txt` in MLPQ
3. Click on every relation except for `player` and `teams` (Do this in order from top to bottom)
4. Zoom into the area where the court is.
5. Either step through the animation, or use the `A` (animate) button to set the speed and play the animation automatically. (A good speed is anywhere from 95 to 98)
